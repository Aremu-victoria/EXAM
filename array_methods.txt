In programming, an array (or list) is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, 
typically of the same type, in a specific order.
 In JavaScript, arrays can hold any type of data and are very flexible.

Five common methods to manipulate arrays in JavaScript:

1. push() – Adds an element to the end of the array.
   Example:
   let arr = [1, 2, 3];
   arr.push(4); // arr is now [1, 2, 3, 4]

2. pop() – Removes the last element from the array.
   Example:
   let arr = [1, 2, 3];
   arr.pop(); // arr is now [1, 2]

3. shift() – Removes the first element from the array.
   Example:
   let arr = [1, 2, 3];
   arr.shift(); // arr is now [2, 3]

4. unshift() – Adds an element to the beginning of the array.
   Example:
   let arr = [1, 2, 3];
   arr.unshift(0); // arr is now [0, 1, 2, 3]

5. splice() – Adds or removes elements at a specific index.
   Example:
   let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
   arr.splice(1, 2); // removes 2 elements from index 1; arr is now [1, 4]
